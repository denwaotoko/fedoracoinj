Everything works now!

For future reference if you want to create a port for a different coin, things you need to change:
SeedPeers.java
NetworkParameters.java
MainNetParams.java
AbstractBlockChain.java <---- RETARGET ALGO IS VERY IMPORTANT!
BuildCheckpoints.java
IrcDiscovery.java (important in case permanent nodes aren't your thing)

And obviously everything involving renaming and rebranding and slapping your name on things.


-------------- ACTUAL README -----------------


To get started, ensure you have the latest JDK installed, and download Maven from:

  http://maven.apache.org/

Then run "mvn clean package" to compile the software. You can also run "mvn site:site" to generate a website with
useful information like JavaDocs. The outputs are under the target/ directory.

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. IntelliJ has Maven integration once you tell it where to
find your unzipped Maven install directory.

Now try running one of the example apps:

  cd examples
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.fedoracoin.examples.ForwardingService <insert a bitcoin address here>

It will download the block chain and eventually print a Bitcoin address. If you send coins to it,
it will forward them on to the address you specified.

Now you are ready to follow the tutorial:
