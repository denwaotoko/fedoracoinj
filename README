vvvvvvvvvvvvvv CURRENT PROBLEMS! vvvvvvvvvvvvvv

Upon creating block chain, the merkle root for the genesis block is WRONG. This is a big no-no.
Probably has something to do with NetworkParameters.java
More specifically, there's a high chance it is the "toNanoCoins(440,0)". I do not fully understand this method,
and reading the BitcoinJ API guide didn't seem to help my situation.

I have also not added any Peers in SeedPeers.java nor MainNetParams.java, so this may be a problem later on.

Again, I'm working on little to no documentation, and I apologize for the crudeness of this repo. 
It's really just a side hobby to tinker with this project and it'd be pretty cool to get this working.

Thanks for your time :)


-------------- ACTUAL README -----------------


To get started, ensure you have the latest JDK installed, and download Maven from:

  http://maven.apache.org/

Then run "mvn clean package" to compile the software. You can also run "mvn site:site" to generate a website with
useful information like JavaDocs. The outputs are under the target/ directory.

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. IntelliJ has Maven integration once you tell it where to
find your unzipped Maven install directory.

Now try running one of the example apps:

  cd examples
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.fedoracoin.examples.ForwardingService <insert a bitcoin address here>

It will download the block chain and eventually print a Bitcoin address. If you send coins to it,
it will forward them on to the address you specified.

Now you are ready to follow the tutorial:
