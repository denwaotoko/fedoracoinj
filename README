vvvvvvvvvvvvvv CURRENT PROBLEMS! vvvvvvvvvvvvvv

WOO FEDORACOIN APP DOESN'T FC AS SOON AS YOU LAUNCH IT NOW! Valid Address generated as well!
Added a few peers.

That being said, it seems to be able to receive now. Unfortunately the block sync stops at Block 9 for an unknown reason.
This prevents the end user from actually sending the coins. This is bad.

Error given in logcat: Difficulty hit proof of work limit: 3fffc0000000000000(many 0's).
Where do you people learn to work this? Am I missing like a "BitcoinJ porting for dummies"?



Again, I'm working on little to no documentation, and I apologize for the crudeness of this repo. 
It's really just a side hobby to tinker with this project and it'd be pretty cool to get this working.

Thanks for your time, and hopefully someone can manage to make this work if I never get it to :)


-------------- ACTUAL README -----------------


To get started, ensure you have the latest JDK installed, and download Maven from:

  http://maven.apache.org/

Then run "mvn clean package" to compile the software. You can also run "mvn site:site" to generate a website with
useful information like JavaDocs. The outputs are under the target/ directory.

Alternatively, just import the project using your IDE. IntelliJ has Maven integration once you tell it where to
find your unzipped Maven install directory.

Now try running one of the example apps:

  cd examples
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.google.fedoracoin.examples.ForwardingService <insert a bitcoin address here>

It will download the block chain and eventually print a Bitcoin address. If you send coins to it,
it will forward them on to the address you specified.

Now you are ready to follow the tutorial:
